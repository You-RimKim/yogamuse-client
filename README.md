## Description
    Yoga Muse is a web application built for yoga teachers by yoga teachers.
    Yoga teachers always have one big issue: Being creative with their flows and sequences.
    Therefore, the platform gives teachers inspiration and the opportunity to explore new poses.
    Users can browse through a collection of yoga poses, save them to their favorites and even create their own yoga categories and poses.

## MVP
    - Users start on the welcome page and see different options on the top/navbar;
        - About
        - Signup
        - Login
    - The about page tells the user about the backstory of this app.
    - On Signup the user is asked to create a profile with an username, email address and password. All fields are required.
    - On Login the user can log into the app and will be redirected to their Profile page.
    - When logged in, more functions can be found:
        - Categories
        - Favorites
        - Profile
        - Logout
    - In the categories section, users can browse through a collection of different asana (pose) categories.
    - They can save each category, which will be displayed in the Favorites section.
    - In the Favorites section users can add their own categories, add new poses to their favorites and modify and ddelete them.

## Backlog Functionalities
    - Future possible features:
        - functionalities such as saving yoga flows and categories to a calendar to plan for teaching sessions
